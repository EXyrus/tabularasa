## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v14.x or above
- **npm or Yarn:** Latest version recommended

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://epoh@dev.azure.com/epoh/TabulaRasa/_git/Website
   cd Website
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash

   ```

## Development

To run the project locally during development:

```bash
npm start
```


This command starts the development server and opens your application in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```


The build artifacts will be stored in the `build` (or `dist`) directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your preferred hosting service.

## Configuration

Environment variables can be set in a `.env` file at the root of the project. For example:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.tabularasa.ng
REACT_APP_OTHER_CONFIG=value
```

Make sure to restart the development server after making changes to the `.env` file.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```


This will execute all the tests and provide you with feedback on code quality and functionality.
